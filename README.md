# Cost-Benefit-Analysis
Financial cost-benefit analysis of a proposed office system using 4-year discounted cash flow modeling (NPV, ROI, break-even) to evaluate IT investment feasibility.
# 📊 Cost-Benefit Analysis – Office System Implementation  
# IT-Cost-Benefit-Analysis  
Financial evaluation project focused on IT investment feasibility using discounted cash flow modeling and financial performance metrics.

---
## Overview  

This project presents a structured financial evaluation of a proposed enterprise office system implementation. The objective is to assess whether the IT investment should be approved by translating development and operational costs into measurable financial outcomes.

The analysis applies discounted cash flow modeling, ROI calculations, and break-even analysis to determine project viability over a four-year payback period.

## Business Objective  

IT investments require significant upfront capital and ongoing operational costs. Without structured financial analysis, organizations risk approving projects that do not generate sufficient returns.

This project aims to:

- Quantify total development and operating costs  
- Forecast revenue growth and operational savings  
- Model annual cash flows over a four-year horizon  
- Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) using a 4% discount rate  
- Determine Return on Investment (ROI)  
- Identify the break-even point  
- Provide a data-driven approval recommendation

## Financial Model Structure  

### 🔹 Development Costs (Year 0)
- Personnel (Systems Analysts, Programmer Analysts, Architect, DB Specialist, etc.)
- Training (Oracle seats)
- Hardware and software (Server, OS, DBMS, client licenses)

### 🔹 Annual Operating Costs
- Ongoing personnel support
- Maintenance agreements
- Preprinted forms
- Personnel cost escalation at 4% annually

### 🔹 Benefits
- Sales increase starting at $30,000 in Year 1 with 10% annual growth
- Inventory savings of $15,000 per year (constant)

## Analytical Framework  

The financial evaluation includes:

- Annual Net Cash Flow calculations  
- Cumulative Cash Flow tracking  
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis  
- Net Present Value (NPV) computation  
- ROI calculation  
- Break-even analysis  

This approach ensures the investment decision is grounded in quantitative financial metrics rather than assumptions.
