## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a structured Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) evaluating the financial feasibility of implementing a new office system. The goal is to determine whether the proposed IT investment should be approved based on quantitative financial metrics.

The analysis follows the financial modeling framework presented in class and incorporates projected costs, benefits, discounted cash flows, and return metrics.

## 📊 Financial Metrics Calculated

The Excel model computes:

- Annual Net Cash Flow  
- Cumulative Cash Flow  
- Present Value of Cash Flows  
- Net Present Value (NPV)  
- Return on Investment (ROI)  
- Break-even Point (Payback Year)

---

## 🧮 Decision Framework

The project should be approved if:

- **NPV > 0**  
- **ROI is positive**  
- **Break-even occurs within 4 years**

This analysis demonstrates how IT investments can be evaluated using structured financial methods rather than intuition alone.
